Export data from dwg files via AutoCAD ActiveX API

This set of Python scripts and other files was born in 2011, when I was working on a task with goal to migrate some data from AutoCAD to a GIS solution.
For data access interface I had chosen AutoCAD ActiveX API (that was a mistake, after all).
For data processing and scripting the Python was selected because it's my favorite programming language.
